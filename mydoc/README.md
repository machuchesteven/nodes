# MyDoc: Redux learning application

This application is created with redux in mind thinking on how different user informations could be stored, updated and retrieved.

It acts as a concept in favor of the past context API that is easy to use and lightweight.

Once the application will be completed, we will use it with backend apis to retrieve information and perfom login and logout. Using 4 systems,

1. A Django API
2. A Rails API
3. A EF API
4. A Dapper API
5. A swagger API -- later in the future

the database we want to use with this application is a learning database. Designed by the Oracle Modelling and Design knowledge first.

## Concepts advanced with this application

1. State management
2. Scalability of User intensive applications
3. Microservices architecture
4. Search features in searching courses
5. Oauth security
6. Mailing support with django
